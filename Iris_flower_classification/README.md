# Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CodSoft**.

## 📂 Project Description
Iris Flower Classification is a simple machine learning project where we use Logistic Regression to classify iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset and achieved **100% accuracy** on the test data.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ✅ Results
- Achieved **Accuracy:** 100%
- Classification Report:
  - Perfect precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes.
- Confusion Matrix shows the correct classification of all test samples.
